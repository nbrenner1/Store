This program simulates a store. The user can log in as an admin or a customer. If they are a new customer, they must create an account. This program implements serialization, so the customer username and password will be saved for the next time the program is run so that the user does not have to create a new account each time. Customers and admin have different functions available to them once they are logged in. Admin can create new inventory items, restock products, remove products from inventory, and create/remove customer accounts. Customers, on the other hand, can shop the store, view and checkout their cart, view their store balance, and add money to their balance by playing a guess the number game.
